# 🤖 Real OCR Setup Guide

Your app is ready for **real picture recognition**! Right now it uses mock data, but you can easily enable real OCR.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Google Vision API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Enable the **Vision API**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **API Key**
5. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App
1. Open `src/services/ocrService.js`
2. Find line 10: `const GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';`
3. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Test with Real Bank Statements
1. Run your app: `npm start`
2. Go to **Tracking** tab
3. Upload a clear photo of a bank statement
4. Watch the AI extract real transactions! 🎉

## 📸 Tips for Best OCR Results

### Photo Quality:
- ✅ Good lighting (avoid shadows)
- ✅ Clear, sharp text (not blurry)
- ✅ Straight angle (not tilted)
- ✅ Full statement visible

### Supported Formats:
- ✅ Bank statements (PDF screenshots work great)
- ✅ Transaction lists
- ✅ Receipt photos
- ✅ Digital banking screenshots

## 🔧 Current Status

**✅ What Works Now:**
- Photo upload (camera + gallery)
- Mock transaction extraction (for testing)
- Smart categorization with learning
- Beautiful UI with progress indicators

**🚧 What Happens With Real OCR:**
- Extracts actual text from your bank statements
- Parses transaction amounts, dates, merchants
- Automatically categorizes based on merchant names
- Learns from your corrections for better suggestions

## 🛡️ Security Notes

### For Production Apps:
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Consider using Firebase Functions for server-side OCR
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Add rate limiting and error handling

### Current Implementation:
- API key is stored in code (fine for personal use)
- All processing happens on device
- No data is stored on external servers

## 🔄 Fallback System

Your app is smart! If the real OCR fails:
- ❌ No API key → Uses mock data
- ❌ Network error → Uses mock data  
- ❌ API limit reached → Uses mock data
- ✅ You can still test all features!

## 📊 Expected Results

With real OCR, you'll see transactions like:
```
15.01.2024 REMA 1000 OSLO -287.50
→ Merchant: "REMA 1000 OSLO"
→ Amount: 287.50
→ Type: expense
→ Suggested Category: grocery
```

The AI will get better at categorizing as you use it more! 🧠✨
